# Slack Basics

## Learning Objectives

* Use notification preferences to control the flood of notifications
* Star rooms, people, and messages to make it easy to find common chats
* Use common keyboard shortcuts to speed navigation in Slack
* Use "anonbot" to ask questions anonymously (along with other useful features)

## Outline

### Get everyone added to all classrooms

- Suggestion: Instructor invites a few students, then asks them to invite all the students around them.

### Notifications

As you join more rooms, it's important to know how to control the flow of
notifications. Personally, I hate when notifications break my focus/flow, so I
tend to turn off as many as I can get away with. Basically, I only get
notifications when someone mentiones my name, DMs me, or there's an `@group` in
an *important* room. Here's how to do that:

#### Suppress `@group` notifications in noisy groups

If you're in a group where people use `@group` too often, you can suppress
those notifications. You'll still see unread counts for new messages.

To do so:
Click the group name -> Group Notification Preferences -> Suppress @group Notifications.

#### Mute non-urgent / non-important groups (e.g. backchannels, frivolous).

A muted room has doesn't display 'unread', and you won't get `@group` notifications. It might be a good idea to mute classroom groups that you're not in for a given week.

To mute a room:
click the group name -> Group Notification Preferences -> Mute

#### Configure general notification preferences.

It's often a good idea to look at the preferences pane (`cmd + ,`) and configure general notification preferences.


### Starring

You can star any chat room/group/person to keep that conversation near the top.

You can also star individual messages and come back to them later by looking at
starred messages. Useful for remembering things.

### Common Shortcuts

* CMD-OPT-Up/Down:  Move to next unread group/person
* CMD-T: Switch to a different group/person

### anonbot

Demo messaging `Help:` to anonbot.

## Solution Branches

### When should you use them?

When you're really stuck, it may be helpful to refer to the solution branch for next steps.

However, please don't copy code and try to pass it off as your own. There's no benefit to you -- there aren't any grades here -- and it will just make the instructors frustrated with you!

### How do you use them?

`git checkout origin/solution`, usually. Then, to get *out* of the solution, `git checkout master`. (Substitute `master` with the name of whatever local branch you want to go into.)
